# NLP
This project is a Flask-based chatbot that uses LlamaIndex and OpenAI GPT to retrieve and process legal documents. Users can query a collection of texts via a web interface, and the chatbot generates AI-driven responses. It integrates vector-based search for accurate retrieval and can be customized for different document types.
